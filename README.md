# ds3vita

**Download**: https://github.com/xerpi/ds3vita/releases

**Enable the plugin:**
1. Add ds3vita.skprx to taiHEN's config (ux0:/tai/config.txt):
	```
	*KERNEL
	ux0:tai/ds3vita.skprx
	```
2. You need to refresh the config.txt by rebooting or through VitaShell.

**Pairing the controller:**
1. Download [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20190120201936/http://dancingpixelstudios.com/sixaxis-controller/sixaxispairtool/)) tool (or [this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sixaxis?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=sixpair.c) other one if you want to compile it yourself)
2. Connect your DS3 or Sixaxis to the PC and open the tool
3. Introduce the Vita's **MAC address plus 1** to the tool (Settings -> System -> System information)

**Using it once paired (see above):**
1. Just press the PS button and it will connect to the Vita

**Note**: If you use Mai, don't put the plugin inside ux0:/plugins because Mai will load all stuff you put in there...
